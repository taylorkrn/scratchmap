# Website Framework which allows users to Register & Log In (Python/Flask)

## Work In Progress, the goal is an App which allows users to create their own online scratch maps

This project was my first experience working with the backend of web-development and helped give me an overview of the following functionality/tools:

- *Registration:* Add new User to database
- *Login:* Test username and Password with the Databse and Log In if there is a match
- *Access to a page only with Login:*
- *Send Email to refresh Password* with TimedJSONWebSignatureSerializer
- *Create and manage Database:* SQLAlchemy

Along with FlaskForms, the html files found in the folder 'templates' allow the Log-In and Registration forms to recognise and reject empty/incongruent imputs.
